# Intro
With BJE we are going to analyze the RNAseq data obtained from KO individuals of the genes on W of *X. laevis*

# Xenbase data
Update on *X. laevis* assembly: W is assembled on 2L! dm-w, ccdc69.w and scan.w are all on 2L.
Blasted the ccdc69.w sequence on genome + Xenopus mRNA: no transcript, same for scan.w.
